{"name":"Loggy","body":"Loggy is a dead simple solution to generating a feed of your logs from your Heroku application. Simply input your API key issued with your registration on Heroku, and the name of your app and POOF like magic loggy will spit out a JSON feed of your logs ready to consume by whatever you wish. This can be deployed on Heroku, but it's not recommended because there is no security layer in this. Your logs will be accesible by anyone with a web browser. Use at your own risk! Feel free to fork, issue a pull request, or even file a bug. I'll try to keep this updated as my log feed needs change.
